This will be my first landing page. It's like a template and doesn't has any relevant content on it.

In this project I will be practicing my skills with HTML and CSS (mainly flexbox usage and styling).

The links and buttons won't work because it's just a template and they are not meant to do anything.

This project is part of The Odin Project course. https://www.theodinproject.com
